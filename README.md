This chrome extension modifies the colors of the chess online site lichess.org

I have made a base css layout according to my own taste
and then used a color hue rotation to get more models

I also hided some blocks of info on the main page and some challenge buttons (I'm terrible at bullet games!)
----
My Lichess Home page modifies the interface of lichess.org using the dark mode
- Change colors at will by rotation the hue from 0 to 360Â°
- Change colors at will by changing the % of saturation from - 35% to + 35%
- Hide areas on the landing page, if you don't want to see them
- Hide challenge speed you don't use

To use it : select the dark mode in lichess 
set your preferences in the popup window

03/15/2024 : Added a popup to change the hue rotation 

03/16/2024 : worked on pop-up design, couldn't show colours rotation directly on popup as it messed up with lichess.org colours (rotation of a rotation) added check-boxes to hide areas in the landing page.

03/17/2024 : some challenge speeds may now be hidden in the lobby (landing page)

03/20/2024 : new css as the syle of lichess has evolved

03/26/2024 : v 1.1, added saturation modification 

08/05/2024 : v 1.3, added bots list filtering by rating range + notes on friends
