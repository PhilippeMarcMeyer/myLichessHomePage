This chrome extension modifies the colors of the chess online site lichess.org

I have made a base css layout according to my own taste
and then used a color hue rotation to get more models

I also hided some blocks of info on the main page and some challenge buttons (I'm terrible at bullet games!)

My Lichess Home page modifies the interface of lichess.org using the dark mode
- Change colors at will by rotation the hue from 0 to 360Â°
- Hide areas on the landing page, if you don't want to see them
- Hide challenge speed you don't use

To use it : select the dark mode in lichess 
set your preferences in the popup window

03/15/2024 : Added a popup to change the hue rotation 

03/16/2024 : worked on pop-up design, couldn't show colours rotation directly on popup as it messed up with lichess.org colours (rotation of a rotation) added check-boxes to hide areas in the landing page.

03/17/2024 : some challenge speeds may now be hidden in the lobby (landing page)
