# myLichessHomePage
This chrome extension modifies the colors of the chess online site lichess.org

I have made a base css layout according to my own taste
and then used a color hue rotation to get more models

I also hided some blocks of info on the main page and some challenge buttons (I'm terrible at bullet games!)

03/15/2024 : Added a popup to change the hue rotation 

Todo : 
- Make a better logo
- Show the color rotation effect inside the popup window
- add some checkboxes to allow hidding some zones in the landing page
- Idem for the challenges speed (bullet, blitz, rapid, classical)
