This chrome extension modifies the colors of the chess online site lichess.org

I have made a base css layout according to my own taste
and then used a color hue rotation to get more models

I also hided some blocks of info on the main page and some challenge buttons (I'm terrible at bullet games!)

03/15/2024 : Added a popup to change the hue rotation 

03/16/2024 : worked on pop-up design, couldn't show colours rotation directly on popup as it messed up with lichess.org colours (rotation of a rotation) added check-boxes to hide areas in the landing page.

03/17/2024 : some challenge speeds may now be hidden in the lobby (landing page)

03/20/2024 : new css as the syle of lichess has evolved
